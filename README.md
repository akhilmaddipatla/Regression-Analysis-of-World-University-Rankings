Comparing the performance of various regression algorithms on University Ranks.

In this project, we take into consideration the three major datasets which are nothing but the world ranking datasets and test the performance of
various regression algorithms by using them on the cleaned and standardized original datasets.
We test the performance of these regression algorithms by taking their predicted value and comparing them against the baselines which are our original ranking
datasets. 

The datasets are:
CWUR dataset
Times Ranking dataset 
Shanghai Ranking datasets

We find the difference between the original rankings and the predicted rankings along with the accuracy of the algorithms.
The decision tree algorithm along with Gradient Boost Regressor and Bagging Regressor gave the most accurate prediction with accuracies of 0.9949, 0.9973 and
0.9968.
Also, we analyse how certain features like quality of education, alumni, awards and other factors influence the final raking outcome using
various graphs and visualizations.
